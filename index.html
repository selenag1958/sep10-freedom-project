              <p>The process of architecture is done by an architect and their tools. An architect is a person who goes through the whole process of planning and construction of a building. They are able to do this through their tools which some have been used for years, while others are more modern and new, and many new ones are to come.This page will show the past present and possible future technology in the field of architecture.</p>

                <h2>Part A</h2>
                <p>Before diving into the furture we must observe and notice our past and present, where we once were and where we are todya. Architecture has come a long way from the building in ancient civilization, now we have developed more efficinet ways to design aside form pen and paper.</p>

              <p>Architecture has evolved and improved in multiple ways however there are still so many different ways in which the tools an architect uses can improve. One possibility is through this app and software called I.N.K which will help architects in designing and building.</p>

              <div class="grid-container">
                <div class="item1">I.N.K was designed to as an app to help make the design process of architecture easier and quicker. The app helps the designer visualize and edit their design based on their preferences</div>

                  <h4>Design</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Gives architects a 3d visual hologram of their building design, as well as help them redesign it from there.</li>
                    <li> 3D instead of 2D, which can analyze every angle</li>
                    <li>Allows achitects to see the surroundings and area of the building.</li>
                    <li>Help be more mindful of surroundings, less accidents will occur.</li>
                    <li>Help visualize the building's design with different materials, meaning they can see how their building would look if it was made with different materials.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>This will allow the architect to send their design to the client</li>
                    <li> Will allow the client to see it in a 3d hologram model.</li>
                    <li> Allows the client to give 3d visual reference of changes they want</li>
                    <li>This app will allow architect to show their previosu designs and creations</li>
                    <li> Will allow architects to save their working progress of a building desing</li>

        <p>Architecture is the planning, designing and building of a building, it's the process of construction of a building. Architecture includes the sketching, and planning of a building as well as the construction process and the building process of a building.This software was designed with the hopes it will support architects.</p>
