### Context
After having chosen Architecture and having already researched part A of my project which is the current and already existing technology related to Architecture, now we have moved on to part B which is the process of coming up with new innovations and new technology related to architecture and that can help architects. For this part I thought about software architects use and how I can create one that has all the necessary tools architects need. I also thought and researched already existing innovations such as virtual reality, augmented reality, BIM, and robotics. I finalized my thoughts by thinking of every aspect an architect would need including the design process and the communication between client and architect.

### EDP
I am currently finishing the brainstorming possible solution process and moving towards planning the most promising solution. Currently I have an idea and plan of what my software will do and how it will help architects design, plan, and create faster and overall better. In this part I am making sure my idea covers everything architects need and use to design and plan their projects.


### My Idea : I.N.K a software app for Architects
My idea for part B is an app that I call I.N.K which is an app that will help architects design quicker and better, as well as helping them get a better understanding of their design and their communication with their client. This software will give architects a 3d visual hologram of the building design, as well as help them redesign it from there. Instead of 2d images, it will be 3d so that architects can analyze every angle of their design. This hologram also allows them to see the surroundings or area of the building, allowing them to  be mindful of the surroundings, when they can be more mindful of the surroundings, less accidents can occur. This software will also help them visualize their building's design with different materials, meaning they can see how their building would look if it was made with different materials.This can avoid any mistakes when performing the actual building, avoiding any mistakes will decrease the wasting of any materials. Not wasting materials means saving and preserving any natural materials. This app will also allow architects to see their design in pencil, marker, and even 3d imaging based on their preference viewing the design, this can help architects view any flaws in their design. Additionally this software will allow the architect to send their design to the client and will allow the client to also see it in a 3d hologram model.

### Skills
Throughout this process I have been learning time management in order to complete and carefully brainstorm an idea useful for architects. Along with this project I have other classes, assessments, and assignments however as I continue to improve my time management skills I am able to complete all of my responsibilities including this blog which will then help me reflect and learn from the process of making this web page. The way I have applied time management is by limiting the amount of procrastination I do on my phone, rather than scrolling on social media I spend my time doing my assignments and also making sure I take care of myself and am well rested. Such a small thing has actually helped me greatly noot only in this assignment but in my overall school work.
Along with time management, one skill that I have used is creativity perhaps without even realizing this project is helping me be more creative and think of the endless possibilities of the future. This part of the project makes us think ahead into the future and how might it be or how it could be. In this part we have had to be creative and think of innovations that haven't been made yet but perhaps in a decade or in a century they may become reality.

### Summary
During this process of the freedom projects I have created an idea of a software that will help architects in multiple ways. During this process one of my takeaways is the skills I gained during this process which was time management and creativity, this will not only help me during this project however in any aspect of my life. As we continue this project I will try to add and improve to my idea of I.N.k a software that is intended to help architects.
