### Context
After having chosen Architecture and having already researched part A of my project which is the current and already existing technology related to Architecture, now we have moved on to par B which is the process of coming up with new innovations and new technology related to architecture and that can help architects. For this part I thought about software architects use and how I can create one that has all the nessesary tools architects need. I finalized my thoughts by thinking of every apect an architect would need including the design proccess and the communication between client and architect.

### EDP
I am currenly finishing he brainstorm possible solution processs and moving towards planning the most promising solution.Currently I have an idea and plan of what my software will do and how it will help architects design,plan, and create faster and overall better. In this part I am making sure my idea covers everything architect need and use to design and plan their projects.

### My Idea : I.N.K a software app for Architects
My idea for part B is an app that I call I.N.K which is an app that will help architects design,quicker,and better as well as helping them get a better understanding of their design and their comminication with their client. This software will gives architects a 3d visual hologram of the building design,as well as help them redesign it from there.Instead of 2d imagr, it will be 3d so that architects can analyze every angle of their design.This hologram also allow them to see the surroundings or area of the building, allowing them to  be mindful of the surroundings, when they can be more mindful of surroundings, less accidents. This software will also help them visualize their building's design with different materials, meaning they can see how their building would look if it was made with different materials.This can avoid any mistakes when performing the actual building, avoiding any mistakes will decrease the wasting of any materials.Not wasting materials means saving and preserving any natural materials.This app will also allow architects to see their design in pencil,marker, and even 3d imaging based on their preference viewing the design can help architects view any flaws.Additionally this software will allow the architect to send their design to the client and allow the client to also see it in a 3d hologram model.

### Skills
Throughout this proccess I have been learning time manegment in order to complete and carefully brainstorm an idea useful for architects. Along with this project I have other classes, assesments, ands assignments however as I contineu to improve my itme management skills I am able to complete all of my responsibilities including this blog which will then help me reflect and learn from the proccess of making this webpage. The way I have applied time management is by limiting the amount of procasinating I do on my phone, rather than scrolling on social media I spent my time doing my assingments and also making sure I take of myself and am well rested. Such a small thing has actually helped me greatly noot only in this assignment but in my overall school work.

### Summary
During this process of the freedom projects I have created an idea of a software that will help architects in multiple ways. During this process one of my takeaways is the skill i gained during this process which was time manegment, this wil not only help me during this project however in any aspect of my life. As we continue this project I will try to add and improve to my idea of I.N.k a software that is intended to help architects.
