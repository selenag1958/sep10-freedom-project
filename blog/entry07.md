## Blog Overview
### Context
It is May a month before the end of the year and we have finally concluded the process of making and presenting our freedom project.The purpose of our freedom project is to test and use the skills we learned in class as well as the tool we learn on our own. The proccess of making the freedom project taught me multiple skill that will be useful in the futre skills such as : learning on your oown, time management, and the importance of organization. Furthermore it opens our creativity to thinking into the future based on our passions and a topic we hope to explore in the future. For some that may be science, finance, or writting however for me it was architeecture.
