## Blog Overview
### Context
It is May a month before the end of the year and we have finally concluded the process of making and presenting our freedom project.The purpose of our freedom project is to test and use the skills we learned in class as well as the tool we learn on our own. The process of making the freedom project taught me multiple skill that will be useful in the future skills such as : learning on your own, time management, and the importance of organization. Furthermore it opens our creativity to thinking into the future based on our passions and a topic we hope to explore in the future. For some that may be science, finance, or writing however for me it was architecture.
