# Entry 7
##### 5/20/25

### Context
It's the end of May the project and presentations are done, the elevator pitch was during two periods in which the SEP students showcase their projects to freshman,juniors, and seniors who have taken the class or may be interesting in taking the class. 
### Product

### Engineering Design Process
As it is May we are in the last steps of the engineering design process which is 8: communicate the results. Now that we have finished the project and presentation it was time to showcase our project to other students in HSTAT.

### Skills
Overall this project taught me many skills such as creativity and organization. This project taught me creativity because one of the main focuses was thinking of how technology can be connected to our topic and create a possible future innovation. It taught me organization because I had to be organized with my code in order to find each section and bug that may have affected my bug.

##### Takeaway
I was one of the last people to present in class, my presentation focused more on my idea for part b which was a software called I.N.K to help architects design quicker and easier, as well as how I incorporated my tool css grid into my wireframe and project. My takeaway for this presentation is to practice speaking better. I was able to speak to the audience, making eye contact, and speaking at a reasonable volume. However I am concerned I may have spoken too fast, and about the few times I stumbled over my words.

### Expo Elevator Pitch
##### Takeaway
The expo was more casual than I had previously thought, my takeaway is that I should have prepared more to say. Because we were told that we only had around 1 minute at most, I shorteened my project explanation, however in the end it was too short. We had more than one minute to speak and I had to improvise in order to make my presentations louder. However overall the expo went well.
