### EDP
We have just finished our MVP which stands for minimum viable product which means a product that still serves its purpose even if there is room for improvement it still gets the job done.

### MVP
In my MVP I added everything important that needed to be in my project except I didn't add color or design because this is meant to be a minimum viable product, less work but it has everything I need. My MVP has the following : 
<ul>
  <li>Context: what architecture is and what architects do</li>
  <li>Part A : Past innovations that helped architects design and improved the process.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Smart pen</li>
    <li>Robotics</li>
    <li>3D printing</li>
    <li>Virtual Reality</li>
    <li>BIM(Building Information Modeling)</li>
    <li>CAD(computer aided design)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Part B: Creating a possible future innovations for architects</li>
    <ul> 
      <li>My Idea : A software called I.N.K that will help simplify the design process</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

### Challenges
While making my MVP adding all code, one of my biggest struggles was adding the accordion for each grid item. I used a grid to add a gallery for part A, each image has an accordion in order to add information about each innovation while taking less space.However adding the accordion came with multiple struggles, either the accordion was too long and took to much space or it opened the same time as others, but at the end I managed to fix the problem, it wasn't perfect but it was functional.

### Skills
Although it may seem basic, one of the skills I learned while making the MVP was actually patience. I really needed patience while making the MVP, I learned to continue despite my multiple fails while making the accordion. It took longer than I had hoped to make the gallery and accordion in Part A. However, that taught me to be patient and get less frustrated, double checking where I may have made a mistake and fixing it.

### Summary
Overall in this part of the process I learned the importance of patience and an MVP. An MVP in my opinion is almost like a fake deadline for one, to have a functional page even if it isn't perfect but something that still works to serve its purpose. Similar to a bike and car they both get you to places however one can be faster,function, and better than the other. Patience is a skill everyone needs and it is useful in all areas of your life.
