### Context
Before creating our freedom project we were learning about different tools then we chose a tool that we would like to learn more about or would help our project most. The tool I chose was the CSS grid, aS its name suggest learning how to make and design a grid using css. 

### Content
With this tool I have been able to learn how to adjust rows and columns the length and width of each grid item. A few variable i've learned with css grid are :

<ul>
  <li>gap-property</li>
  <li>justify-item</li>
  <li>grid/span</li>
</ul>

#### Gap-property
The gap property is used in order to create a gap of space between rows and columns in the grid, so that it may be more open and make it more pleasant to view.

#### Justify-item
Justify item is used to align the material inside a grid item, for example align a text to the right, or align an image in the middle.
##### start
<img src = "https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/justify-items-start.svg" height=200 width =200>

##### end
<img src= "https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/justify-items-end.svg" height = 200 width = 200>

##### center
<img src= "https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/justify-items-center.svg" height = 200 width =200>

##### stretch
<img src = "https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/justify-items-stretch.svg" height = 200 width = 200>

#### Grid/span
The grid span is used to adjust how much space we want a grid item to take, for example if we want a heading or image to take up half or the full length of the grid.

<img width="446" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be22b49a-1397-4050-92a6-f626f0ddce57" />

##### code 

```css
.item1 {
  grid-column: 1/span 2 ;
}
```

### Skills
Throughout learning my tool, one skill or takeaway I've had is the importance of note taking. During the time period in which I've been learning how to use css grid, I've taken notes of every property I've learned in order to be able to look back at and learn how to use my tool better.

### Summary
Overall during this process, learning the css grid will be helpful in formatting the content I will be adding to my freedom project. Furthermore it allowed me to learn a valuable css tool, a grid can be a simple but effective tool in order to improve one's content and information.
