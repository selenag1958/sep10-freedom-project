### My choice : Architecture

The topic I chose for this project was architecture. I chose it because it's one of the careers I hope to achieve. I was always interested in designing and even though there are many other similarities such as interior design, graphic design I chose architecture because I wanted to design something creative. Rather than planning how the inside of a building would look I wanted to design the building itself. Architecture wasn't my only choice however I am interested in interior design and business. Interior design is a good way to use creativity and business is simply a topic I have always been drawn to. As much as I considered these ideas overall I was more interested and drawn to architecture which ended up being my final decision.

### Enginering Design Progress

I am currently in the first step of my designing progress. I am defining the problems that are in the department of architecture. I hope to be able to find a solution for these problems.

### Skills

#### skill 1 
One skill I have is problem decomposition, meaning I can break down problems in order to solve them.When faced with a problem I gather what I understand and what I don't understand in order to properly figure out the problem and do my best to solve it.
#### skill 2 
Another skill I have is that I am organized. I use a planner to organize my tasks and assignments, as well as check my emails frequently in order to make sure I don't miss any task I have to do.
