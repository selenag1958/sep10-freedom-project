### My choice : Architecture

The topic i chose for this project was architecture. I chose it because its one of the careers I hope to achieve. I was always interested in designing and even though there are many other similar such as interior design,graphic design i chose architecture because i wanted to design something creater.Rather than planning how the inside of a building would look i wanted to design the building itself. Architecture wasnt my only choice however i am interested in interior design and business. Interior design is a good way to use creativity and bussiness is simply a topic i have always been drawn to. As much as did consider these ideas overall i was more interested and drawn to architecture which eneded up being my final decision.

### Enginering Design Progress

I am currently in the first step of my designing progress. I am defining the problems that are in the department of architecture. I hope to be able to find a solution for these problems.
