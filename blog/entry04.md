### Context
I already have my topic which is architecture and I have an idea of an innovation for architects, however now we had to look over a list of different tools that we can use on our project, and we had to choose one to really focus on, and learn more about in order to improve our projects. Some tools that caught my attention were css grid and animate.css. CSSgrid allowed you to organize your web page in rows and columns forming a grid, while animate.css allowed you to improve your animations using css code.

### EDP
I am in between brainstorming possible solutions and planning a solution design process, in this process after learning and testing the different tools we had to choose one tool that we would learn more about and apply it to our project. I chose css grid as my tool for this project, because I plan on using css to help me format and organize my webpage so it may be informative, but simple and easy to read so that many will understand my idea.

### Content
Before choosing css grid I had the chance to use it, and learn the basic code in order to create a grid. The grid is made up of 2 things: the grid container which is the div parent element and the grid items inside the container.
There are many properties you can add to your grid to make it according to your preference such as: 
<li><b>align-context:</b> Vertically aligns the whole grid inside the container</li>
<li><b>align-items :</b> Aligns content in a grid item along the column axis(y-axis)</li>
<li><b>align-self:</b> Aligns the content for a specific grid item along the column axis(y-axis)</li>
<li><b>Display :</b> specify the display behavior(how it looks ex: grid or inline-grid)</li>
<li><b>column-gap:</b> specifies the gap between columns.</li>

### Skills
This process allowed me to learn how to learn a topic on my own because we had to learn how to use a tool and also try coding with that tool in order to practice. We had to use the resources given to us or had to look for our own resources whether that be videos, examples, or websites in order to learn and put to practice the code we learned. We were in charge of understanding the basics of our tool and what they work for.
While learning from css grid I was able to create a grid:

### Summary
During this process of the freedom project my takeaway is that I was able to start learning how to teach myself a topic and learn on my own. This skill will help me not only with the freedom project but in other aspects of my life, in any class or subject that I may struggle in I will be able to learn on my own and help myself improve.
