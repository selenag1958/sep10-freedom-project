### Context
Previously I had chosen Architecture for my topic and then I was in the process of researching sorftware and hardware in technology. Meaing apps and websites or physical technology appliance in Architecture.

### My software researching
I began with researching about apps and websites that architects use in order to design buildings, so i searched technology in architects and it showed a list of different technology advances that isnow used in architecture. 

<ul>
  <li>virtual reality</li>  
  <li> artificial intelligence </li>
  <li>augmented reality</li>
  <li>3d printing </li> 
  <li>robotics</li>
  <li>cloud computing</li>
</ul>

After seeing the options I had found i decided to focus mostly on 3 robotics,BIM,augmented and virtual reality.

### Robotic
<ul>
<li>Robotics: The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots.</li>
<li>Architecture students learning about robots in constructions https://news.njit.edu/architecture-students-learning-about-robots-construction</li>
</ul>

### Augmented reality/Virtual reality
<ul>
<li>A technology that lays a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view.</li>
 <li>Virtual reality may improve communication and understanding between the client and architect.

</ul>

### BIM
<ul>
<li>BIM= Building Information Modeling: A technology that uses 3D models and digital data to manage information of a building.</li>
<li>Software program to help with BIM https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/architect</li>
</ul>
