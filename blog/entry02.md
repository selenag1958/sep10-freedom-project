### Context
Previously I had chosen Architecture for my topic and then I was in the process of researching software and hardware in technology. Meaning apps and websites or physical technology appliance in Architecture.

### My software researching
I began with researching about apps and websites that architects use in order to design buildings, so I searched technology in architects and it showed a list of different technology advances that is now used in architecture. 

<ul>
  <li>virtual reality</li>  
  <li> artificial intelligence </li>
  <li>augmented reality</li>
  <li>3d printing </li> 
  <li>robotics</li>
  <li>cloud computing</li>
</ul>

After seeing the options I had found I decided to focus mostly on 3 robotics,BIM,augmented and virtual reality.

### Robotic
<ul>
<li>Robotics: The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots.</li>
<li>Architecture students learning about robots in constructions https://news.njit.edu/architecture-students-learning-about-robots-construction</li>
</ul>

### Augmented reality/Virtual reality
<ul>
<li>A technology that lays a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view.</li>
 <li>Virtual reality may improve communication and understanding between the client and architect.

</ul>

### BIM
<ul>
<li>BIM= Building Information Modeling: A technology that uses 3D models and digital data to manage information of a building.</li>
<li>Software program to help with BIM https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/architect</li>
</ul>

### EDP
After researching and learning about what technologies and softwares architects use, the next step of the project was to search and learn more about what hardware architects use in architecture. Hardware being the physical appliance of technology in architecture. Upon researching what I found was the uses of digital locks.

### Digital door locks
Digital door locks are door locks that function by electricity. They can be monitored from your phone or other electronic device and may more efficient for those who don't want to carry around a key.There are different type of digital door locks.

#### Password code
There is a model where above the handle there is a small digital screen with a number where you put in your password rather that using a key similar to a password on your personal device.

#### Fingerprint recognition 
Aside from the passcode model there is another where either the door handle or below the handle there is a fingerprint button where the door opens once it recognizes your finger print also similar to how your personal device works.

#### Benfits from smart door locks.
<ul>
  <li> Improve security without changing or altering the original design</li>
  <li>Smart doors allow the individual to lock and unlock their house through the phone</li>
  <li>Can be programmed to lock for a certain time ensuring its never left unlock when people aren't in the house</li>
</ul>
